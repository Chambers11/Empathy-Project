## Description 
 We all come from different walks of life, and sometimes we struggle to understand other peoples views due to the experiences they've had that we ourselves have not gone through. Loss of a Limb is our chance to have a glimpse of life through the eyes of  another, in hope to invoke perspective shaping or changing empathy.  

This application explores Virtual Reality 360 videos and Virtual Reality Simulation as tools for building  empathy, comparing which of the two  medium is more effective at Inducing empathy. The application combines the two aforementioned VR  medium to give a  virtual window in to the life of a double amputee, and the idea was inspired by [Purple Heart Homes]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPYU4Hh4-k4) .
